    we have a WORKING script folks.  Everything looks to be plotting as intended.  Minor code commenting, but all but done.

    Trying to figure out how to specify legend/subplot title information.  Bulk of the actual plot is done. :L

    Part-way through 2D plot still.  3D has changed little.  Also writing comments describing what both plots depict and how they are coded now.

    Making checkpoint for gradual development.  Fine tuning and considering optional input to modify plot based on user perference.

    Scatter3D is my new best friend.  3D plot looks to be plotting as intended and automatically saving as a pdf.  Minor adjustments to be made.  Soon moving on to fixing up 2D plot.  Whoot.

    Ladies and gentlemen hold the phone, scatter3d just came out in the 11th hour with some serious potential.  Trying to configure the plots to make clear distinctions of each signal by surronding each point w/ black outline, as well as add a legend for enumerated number -> signal.  Also WORKING

    Graph is now depicting what I need it to.  Cannot fill area under the curve due to package limitations, however (across all packages, including ggplot, plotly, plot3d and its branches, etc.).  Now trying to clean up 2D plot while waiting for email back about what may be an issue with the 3D one.

    Gradual progress, but not big developments.  Making a check point as I try using plot3d.

    Officially have a working render with plotly, but plenty of issues still persist, namely of how I'm going to fill in the area under the curve, and if I can modify it as I want without the ggplot functions.  Just sent an email.  Thanks for your help all.

    Making checkout point for now.  Trying to use tip of 'melting' df, but not entirely clear how to even output plotly yet.  Still also not sure why inserting y variable in ggplot for line plot causes bash to continue processing indefinitely.

    Stuck right now trying to understand why ggplot freezes when setting the y variable to its respective signal_df[[columnname]].  Need to install plotly js application to plot in browser, or figure out how to do so offline.

    Decent progress.  Can successfully output normal line plot.  Trying to fill area under it with scaling colour gradient.  Also working on representing all line charts in 3D from diagonal view.

    OMG I FIXED THE DATAFRAME TITLES PRAISE BE.  Okay, dataframe now has a column1 = 'Time', meaning index values now start at 1.  Will be using column1 as the X axis for all forthcoming plots and analyses.  Yay.
